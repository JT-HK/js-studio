# Animator & AnimatorListener

<code>Animator</code> is an object class which registers rendering functions from objects and executes them repeatedly in a rate depended on the native window browser's <code>requestAnimationFrame</code> call-back method.

<code>AnimatorListener</code> is an interface object class which handles events triggered from Animator.
Each instance of <code>AnimatorListener</code> is required to be appended to an <code>Animator</code> object.
